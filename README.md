# Deep Learning Project
# üß† Deep Learning - Image Detection Project

This Deep Learning project focuses on detecting images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It was developed using Google Colab and explores how deep learning models can accurately classify images from a dataset.

## üìå Project Highlights

- Built with **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
- Utilizes **CNN architecture**
- Trained on image dataset (mention dataset if known)
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, loss curves, etc.
- Deployed and tested via Google Colab

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
- Deep Learning Concepts (Convolutions, Pooling, Dropout, etc.)

- ## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Deeplearning_Image_Detection_Project.git
   cd Deeplearning_Image_Detection_Project
Install dependencies:

open bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

‚úÖ Output
